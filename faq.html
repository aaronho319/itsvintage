				<b class="faq-questions">I don’t know what time I can drop by! Do you accept online reservations?</b> <br /> 

				The shop works on a pop-up basis at the moment, with every pop-up shop operating at different hours. We do not accept online reservations, as each item is one of a kind. Best to follow us on Instagram to stay updated on store hours and stock. <br /> <br />

				<b class="faq-questions">Can I drop by any time? Do you have a lunch break? </b><br />

				Our pop-up shops operate at different hours. Feel free to drop by whenever we’re open! <br /> <br />

				<b class="faq-questions">Do you accept returns?</b>  <br /> 

				We do not accept returns or exchanges. We state clearly that the items are vintage and may show signs of wear and age. It is the customer’s responsibility to inspect the items well before proceeding with their purchase. <br /> <br />

				<b class="faq-questions">How does your sizing go? If free size, what sizes does it usually fit? <br /></b>

				We offer all kinds of clothing that are both for men and women, across different sizes. We recommend that you visit the pop-up shop and try on the clothes for yourself. <br /> <br />

				<b class="faq-questions">Where do you source your pieces? Do you clean them beforehand? <br />  </b>

				We source our items from around the world: estate sales, flea markets, bazaars, and suppliers. All our items are professionally cleaned before they are sold in the shop. <br /> <br />

				<b class="faq-questions">My piece has a smell on it. How do I get rid of it? <br /> </b>

				Most items we offer can be machine-washed, although we recommend that you hand wash them as the fabric can be delicate. While we are confident that our team professionally clean the garments, it is the customer’s responsibility to inspect the item before purchase. <br /> <br />

				<b class="faq-questions">What are your available payment methods? <br />  </b>

				We currently offer cash and BDO web transfer at our pop-up shops. <br /> <br />

				<b class="faq-questions">What era are you most nostalgic for? <br /> </b>

				We love the way people dressed in the ‘70s, particularly rock bands and groupies. There’s just something cool about people who are unapologetic and fearless in dressing up. <br /> <br />

				<b class="faq-questions">What has been your own favorite vintage find? <br />  </b>

				We found a baseball shirt in a Japan thrift store that was from Olongapo, Zambales. It probably belonged to some American GI in the ‘60s who bought it as a souvenir. We also found an original B-3 jacket that was used in the war. Even though it’s too warm to wear a fur and shearling jacket in the Philippines, it’s such a cool piece. <br /> <br />

				<b class="faq-questions">How do you curate your pieces? What kind of pieces do you look for? <br />  </b>

				We’re always on the lookout for pieces that look like they have a story to tell. The best part about curating vintage pieces is that we never know what we’re going to find. We’re always excited to put that out for someone to hopefully enjoy. <br /> <br />

				<b class="faq-questions">Why did you want to do It’s Vintage? <br />  </b>

				It all started when owner Fed Pua realized that he didn’t want to shop abroad or on eBay anymore! He wanted to make vintage clothing accessible to people here, to promote individuality and sustainability. <br /> <br />
